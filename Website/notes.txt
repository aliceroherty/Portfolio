TO DO:
	Migrate any margins, font sizes, widths, etc. into media queries

	Fix Button and dropzone text on add post section

	Add error messages to dropzone.

    Fix nav on mobile. When navigating to a section using the hamburger menu the section is pushed down by the menu.

	Maybe set visibility:hidden on button on the onleave for any section that isnt the home section to get rid of the  button flying across the screen

	PHP Post Delete doesn't account for images that may be left behind
