	Use Jquery to loop through all divs with class blogPost
	Add two closing divs tags and two opening div tags (one with class slide and one with slideContainer) after each blog post
	Make sure the last post only has two closing div tags no opening

	Change slideContainers to justify content center than add margin-right: 3.5%; on the first two cards in the container.
